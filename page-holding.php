                <p>Erick Turner, previously worked at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), acting as gatekeeper for new psychotropic drugs seeking to enter the US market and saw how vast amounts of data relevant to drug efficacy and safety never see publication. Since leaving the FDA for Oregon Health &amp; Science University, he has written several papers drawing attention to the Drugs@FDA website as a valuable source of unbiased clinical trial data. He has published papers demonstrating the degree to which selective publication exaggerates the efficacy of drugs used to treat depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. He has published a how-to paper in the BMJ5 in order to demystify Drugs@FDA and encourage other researchers to make use this trove of clinical trial data.</p>
